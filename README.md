Machine Learning project about predicting lap times in Formula 1. 

Submission as final project for bootcamp.

## Predicting Lap Times in Formula 1

This project analyzes data generated in an F1 session to predict lap time. Using FastF1 API we gather lap and weather data and determines relevant features to use for our target variable. 

Compares various models performances on practice and qualifying datasets.

Short slide presentation is included in .pdf format.

*EDIT* Critiqued that I initially didn't compare any linear models. Added and compared linear models in final version of the notebook.
